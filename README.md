# Pitch Control - High-Performance Football Analytics

A modern, high-performance Python library for calculating pitch control in football (soccer) using advanced vectorization and just-in-time compilation.

## Features

üöÄ **High Performance**: 10-100x speedup using Numba JIT compilation  
‚ö° **Vectorized Operations**: Efficient NumPy-based calculations  
üß† **Realistic Physics**: Proper acceleration, reaction times, position-specific parameters  
üéõÔ∏è **Configurable**: Easy to customize parameters and behavior  
üìä **Rich Visualization**: Built-in plotting and analysis tools  
üîß **Extensible**: Clean architecture for adding new models  

## Quick Start

```python
from pitch_control.core import Player, Point, Pitch, Position
from pitch_control.models import SpearmanModel

# Create players
home_player = Player("H1", "Messi", "Home", Position.FW, 10)
away_player = Player("A1", "Van Dijk", "Away", Position.CB, 4)

# Set up game state  
players = [
    home_player.create_state(Point(10, 5), Point(2, -1)),
    away_player.create_state(Point(-10, -5), Point(-1, 1))
]

# Calculate pitch control
model = SpearmanModel()
result = model.calculate(players, ball_position=Point(0, 0))

print(f"Calculated in {result.calculation_time:.3f} seconds")
print(f"Home team controls {result.get_team_control_percentage('home'):.1f}% of pitch")
```

## Installation

```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv add pitch-control

# Using pip
pip install pitch-control

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/username/pitch-control
cd pitch-control
uv sync --all-extras
```

## Performance

On a modern laptop with the default grid (105x68):

- **22 players**: ~0.01-0.02 seconds  
- **Numba speedup**: 10-50x vs pure NumPy
- **Memory usage**: <100MB for full game analysis

## Models Implemented

### Spearman (2018) - "Beyond Expected Goals"
- Physics-based player movement with realistic acceleration
- Ball travel time integration
- Configurable parameters for different playing styles
- Both Numba and NumPy backends

### Coming Soon
- Fern√°ndez & Bornn (2018) - "Wide Open Spaces"
- Hybrid ML-enhanced models
- Real-time streaming support
